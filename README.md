**Why did you choose this subject?**
Because of the increasing popularity of mobile devices. I think knowing the basics of mobile app development can be very helpful in building mobile apps or working on mobile app projects. Mobile app development can also be a good way to learn new programming languages and technologies, and can provide many opportunities for career growth and advancement.

**How were you first made aware of it?**
GA Software Engineer bootcamp

**What problem does it solve?**
React Native solves the problem of building mobile applications that work well on both iOS and Android platforms, while also providing a native-like experience to the end-user. Traditionally, building mobile applications required developers to use platform-specific programming languages and frameworks, which resulted in duplicate code and time-consuming development processes.

**How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?**
By providing a framework for building mobile applications using a single codebase that works on both iOS and Android. By leveraging the power of JavaScript and React, developers can write code once and deploy it to both platforms, saving time and resources. It also solves the problem of creating performant mobile applications.

**What is it similar to, if anything?**
React

**Who built it and why?**
React Native was developed by Facebook, with the initial release in 2015. The project was led by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook who also created the original React library.
The primary motivation behind the development of React Native was to provide a solution for building high-performance mobile applications using web development technologies. Facebook had previously developed a native mobile app for their social networking platform, but found that maintaining two separate codebases for their iOS and Android apps was a challenge.
React Native was built to solve this problem by allowing developers to write code once and use it across multiple platforms. By using React Native, developers can use JavaScript and React to create native mobile apps for iOS and Android, while also benefiting from the performance and user experience advantages of native apps.

**Who is maintaining it?**
It is maintained by Facebook

**What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?**
React Native is a powerful tool for building mobile app, it's similar to those used in building web app with React, which can make it easier for developers who are already familiar with React to start building mobile apps. So it wasn't that hard to understand the concept and syntax of it. 

**What resources do you recommend for interested students?**
The React Native documentation is an excellent resource to start learning React Native. The official documentation provides a comprehensive guide to React Native, including installation instructions, tutorials, and detailed API references.
